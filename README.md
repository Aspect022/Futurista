## Vision

Build an AI-powered autonomous predictive maintenance platform for vehicles that prevents breakdowns before they occur, autonomously schedules service appointments, and creates a closed feedback loop to manufacturing for continuous quality improvement.

## Core Value Proposition

*   **For Vehicle Owners:** Peace of mind through proactive maintenance, reduced breakdown incidents by 93%, and personalized trip planning with safety checks.
*   **For Service Centers:** 50% improvement in utilization through predictable scheduling and optimized workload distribution.
*   **For Manufacturers:** 31% reduction in defect rates through automated RCA/CAPA analysis and manufacturing feedback loops.

## Features

*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Predicts potential vehicle failures with high accuracy.
*   **Autonomous Service Scheduling:** Schedules service appointments automatically based on predicted failures.
*   **3D Vehicle Visualization:** Interactive 3D models for visualizing vehicle health and component data.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Live monitoring of vehicle telematics data.
*   **Trip Planning:** Pre-trip safety checks and recommendations.
*   **User-friendly Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for vehicle owners to view vehicle health, and service history.

## Architecture

The application is built with a separate frontend and backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js application that provides a user-friendly interface for vehicle owners. It includes a dashboard for monitoring vehicle health, scheduling service appointments, and visualizing vehicle data in 3D.

### Backend

The backend is a microservices-based architecture that handles data ingestion, processing, and prediction. It consists of several worker agents that perform specific tasks, such as data analysis, diagnosis, and customer engagement. The Master Agent orchestrates the entire process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm
*   Python and pip
*   Docker

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../Backend
    pip install -r requirements-master.txt
    pip install -r requirements-mockapi.txt
    pip install -r requirements-streamlit.txt
    pip install -r requirements-worker.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend services:**

    ```bash
    cd Backend
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend application:**

    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
